SERVER & WEBSITE CLEANUP SUMMARY


WHAT HAPPENED
- A DigitalOcean droplet hosting multiple church websites was flagged for suspicious activity.
- DigitalOcean temporarily blocked the droplet at the network level.
- To continue cleanup, a new droplet was created and access was restored so remediation could be completed.

WEBSITES INVOLVED
- ecclesiahills.org
- wetouchtheworld.org
- collidecentral.com

- All sites use WordPress as the CMS.
- Cloudflare is used for DNS, CDN, and security.
- DigitalOcean is the hosting provider.

WHAT WAS DONE
- Regained SSH access after DigitalOcean lifted the network block.
- Created two server users for access:
  - deploy
  - sysadmin
- Identified WordPress installations on the server.
- Confirmed WordPress files for wetouchtheworld.org are located at:
  WordPress application directory
  (mounted into the WordPress container)
- Installed Wordfence (there was no WordPress security plugin previously).
- Ran security scans which flagged multiple files and plugins in critical or unsafe states.
- Deleted or repaired compromised files.
- Uninstalled and reinstalled affected plugins from clean sources.
- Repaired WordPress core files where necessary.
- Restored required theme plugins:
  - WPBakery Visual Composer
  - Slider Revolution
- Reactivated plugins that were previously active to return sites to original behavior.
- Fixed frontend and layout issues caused during reinstalls, including the homepage/slider area on wetouchtheworld.org.
- Reset WordPress admin password(s).
- Configured Wordfence alerts to notify the admin going forward.
- Purged Cloudflare cache.
- No Cloudflare zones or DNS records were deleted.

CURRENT STATE
- Websites are loading normally.
- Security scan alerts cleared after remediation.
- No recurring malicious activity observed.
- Access details will be shared directly for continuity.

RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS
- Enable 2FA on:
  - WordPress
  - Cloudflare
  - DigitalOcean
- Rotate passwords if desired.
- Review admin users.
- Decide when to delete the old droplet.
- Consider modernizing the setup, as parts of the stack are relatively old.
- Optionally separate the sites onto different droplets to reduce future risk.
